# Calculator

This project is mainly about learning how to use pytetst and its features. 

This was done by first creating a simple calculator and creating exceptions that would cause errors and then creating another .py file starting with "test_" and making tests to see if our main .py file would react as it should! If so then all tests should be passed when "pytest" is typed in the Terminal!
